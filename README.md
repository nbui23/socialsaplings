# SocialSaplings

## Inspiration

Our planet's lungs are gasping for air. With **15 billion trees** being cut down annually, the ripple effects on climate, ecosystems, and biodiversity are catastrophic. The urgency to combat deforestation and promote reforestation has never been more critical. Inspired by the KuriusHacks March Edition's Earth Challenge, we envisioned SocialSaplings as a beacon of hope and innovation. This platform is not just a project; it's a global call to arms to protect our trees, encourage reforestation, and underscore the irreplaceable value trees add to our world, beyond mere timber.

## What it does

Making SocialSaplings was really exciting because we got to use lots of different tech to help trees and bring people together. We used Firebase for keeping track of data and making sure users can log in, and we used basic web tools like HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to make the site look good and work well. For the more technical parts, we chose Node.js and Express.js to handle requests and organize our app.

Our Tree Recommendation Tool was cool because it figured out where users were and suggested the best trees to plant there, using weather, soil, and other data from different services. We had to do a lot of research to make sure our advice was spot on.

We used the Google Maps API to show where people have planted trees on a map, making it fun and easy for others to join in. Our social media feed made our community lively, showing posts and updates in real time.

User profiles showed how much each person has helped by planting trees and how much CO2 those trees have taken out of the air, which was really motivating. The game part was made with HTML Canvas and Tiled, adding a playful way to see the impact of planting trees.

Lastly, we put together a Resource Page with helpful info on saving trees, stopping deforestation, and how to start planting, making sure everyone had the knowledge to get involved.

All these parts came together in SocialSaplings, showing our hard work and desire to make a difference in reforesting the planet.

## Challenges we ran into

During our work on SocialSaplings, we ran into a few tough spots that really made us think and work hard. Getting a Node server to run smoothly was tricky at first, and we also had some problems with Firebase not always connecting right and with keeping track of user sessions. These issues made us dig deep to figure things out and make everything work better. Learning how to use new tools like SoilGrids and GBIF was also a challenge because we weren't used to their guides and how they work, which meant we had to learn a lot quickly. Making the game part of our project was a big job too. We had to come up with a fun game that included moving around, planting trees, and interacting with the game world, which meant solving some complex problems. These obstacles were tough but actually helped us grow. We learned a lot, came up with creative solutions, and made our project stronger.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We're really proud of what we've done with SocialSaplings. Every part of our project looks great, showing how much we care about making something that's easy and fun to use. The Tree Recommendation Tool is a big win for us, using different services smoothly to give people good advice on planting trees where they live. Our Tree Map works perfectly, letting people see and add to the tree-planting efforts worldwide. The Social Media Feed is alive with posts that get people talking and working together. The User Profile stands out by showing how much each person has helped and the good impact they've made, which encourages them to do more. Plus, the game part of our project is more fun and rewarding than we hoped, making the whole experience of helping the planet enjoyable. 

## What we learned

While working on SocialSaplings, we learned a lot. We got better at using JavaScript, which helped us make our website work well. We also learned how to use new tools like SoilGrids, GBIF, and Google Maps to add cool features to our app. Making a game taught us about using HTML Canvas and Tiled, which was really fun and new for us. We improved our skills with Firebase, learning how to keep our app's data safe and manage who can log in. We used Postman to check if our app was talking to other services correctly, and we learned how to organize our app's server with Express. All of this learning made our project better and taught us a lot for future projects.

## What's next for SocialSaplings

Bigger Tree Recommendation Database
- Add more types of trees to our list, especially those that are good for different places and those at risk of disappearing.
- Work with tree experts to make sure our advice is top-notch.

Mobile App
- Create an app to make it easier to join in, track trees, and connect with others.
- The app will have reminders, a way to see your planting projects, and updates from the community.

Enhanced Tree Tracking with AI
- Train ML model using data on climate, biodiversity, soil, and topography to predict the growth and health of trees.

Partnerships for Sustainability
- Team up with companies that want to help fund tree planting.
- These partnerships can help pay for more trees to be planted and get more people involved.

Better Reporting and Seeing Your Impact
- Make cool tools to show how much good your trees are doing, like how much CO2 they've taken out of the air.
- Add future predictions to show how your trees will help the planet down the line.

These updates will make SocialSaplings even better, helping us plant more trees and show everyone the great things we can do together for our planet.
